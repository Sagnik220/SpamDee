#### 1.***Pre-Processing/Cleaning of Data:***
The dataset has lot of word's that are useless to us,specific words like Sale,Offer indicate's that a message can be spam as well all get messages like these in our day to day lives.So there
comes a need to pre-process or to clean our dataset to exclude words that do not specify like anything significant.This will result in faster output's as all the unecessary data is cutoff.
#### 2.***Data Segragation/Categoring word into Spam/Ham***
Now we are already given Categorized dataset which classifies the sentences into spam or ham,so after pre-processing we can just parse through the spam and ham sentences to categorize specific words into spam or ham.

#### 3.***Model Testing***
We are using Naive-Bayes Algorithm to solve this problem of Text-Classification.
